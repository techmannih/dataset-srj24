# dataset-srj24

Simple Route JSON dataset generated from 26 production-oriented KiCad and
Altium boards. The first 20 sources are pinned to immutable Git commits,
redistributed under Apache-2.0, and retained byte-for-byte in `kicad_pcb/`.
The six Texas Instruments Altium sources are pinned by SHA-256 to official TI
design-resource archives; their PcbDoc files are not redistributed here.

The selection excludes testbeds, simulation boards, ICT fixtures, archived
projects, and repositories described upstream as experimental. The designs are
complete hardware projects intended for their documented functional use. This
dataset validates source integrity and conversion, but it is not an independent
electrical-safety or manufacturing certification.

## Repository structure

- `kicad_pcb/` contains the exact upstream KiCad boards.
- `circuit-json/` contains converter output for each board.
- `samples/` contains Simple Route JSON with existing top-level routing removed.
- `snapshots/` contains labeled, side-by-side original Altium, converted Circuit
  JSON, and SRJ SVGs for the TI samples.
- `source-files.json` records immutable provenance, license links, descriptions,
  features, statistics, converter warnings, compatibility normalizations, and
  any unambiguous missing-port repairs.
- `src/` and `index.html` provide the same local viewer structure as
  `dataset-srj18`.

Compatibility normalization is applied only to the in-memory conversion input.
It removes unsupported graphic UUIDs or routing-state fields that do not affect
the unrouted SRJ problem. Missing PCB ports are repaired only when a connected
source port has exactly one pad or plated-hole candidate with the matching pin
hint. The checked-in `.kicad_pcb` files are never rewritten.

## Licensing

Original code and documentation in this repository are licensed under the MIT
License unless otherwise stated. The unmodified boards in `kicad_pcb/` and
their generated board data remain under Apache-2.0. The TI-derived Circuit
JSON, SRJ, and comparison snapshots are subject to the applicable
[TI Terms of Use](https://www.ti.com/legal/terms-conditions/terms-of-use.html);
the native PcbDoc files are downloaded only during regeneration and are not
redistributed by this repository. The repository-level MIT license does not
relicense third-party materials. The full policy is in `LICENSE`, the
Apache-2.0 text is in
`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`, and immutable source attribution is in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `source-files.json`. None of the pinned upstream
revisions contains a root `NOTICE` file.

## Usage

```js
const { sample001, dataset } = require("@tscircuit/dataset-srj24")
```

## Regenerate and validate

```sh
bun install
bun run generate
bun run test
bun run build
```

The generators download each pinned source, verify its commit or SHA-256,
convert it to Circuit JSON, and then produce Simple Route JSON. The TI samples
store the released Altium converter and SRJ output without repairing or
normalizing it; the comparison SVGs make the resulting conversion limitations
visible.
